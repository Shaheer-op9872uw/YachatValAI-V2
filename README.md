## 🏁 How to Run

Follow these simple steps to get the yacht price predictor sailing:

1. **Open the Google Colaboratory Notebook**  
   Click here: [**Open in Colab**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cW0UqPpxMQ5XRQ9jMbDYHUMrrmea2-T2?usp=sharing)  

2. **Upload the Dataset**  
   Download `yacht_prices_25k.csv` from this GitHub repo.  
   Upload it to the Colab notebook when prompted.  

3. **Run All Cells**  
   Start from the top and run all code cells in order.  
   This will:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset  
   - Train the Cerebra-style model  
   - Prepare the interactive CLI for predictions  

4. **Use the CLI**  
   After training, run the command:  
   ```
   run_control_panel()
   ```
The panel will ask you 5 questions about your yacht: country, year, type, length, and brand prestige.

Enter your answers naturally.

It will output a predicted fair price for your yacht. 🎯

Enjoy exploring yacht pricing like never before! 🚤💨
